# Intro & Objective
Uncovering insights around tiktok audio popularity and performance across a variety of criteria, specifically during TikTok's early days 
thru the first year of COVID (roughly). Across the 30-months this analysis was performed on, we'll be able to find out things like:
1. In that time, who was the King / Queen of TikTok audio?
2. What audio held the most number 1 monthly leaderboard spots? Most top 10 appearances?
3. Are official songs or original sounds more likely to dominate the popularity leaderboards? 

For avid current and ex-TikTok users, how many of these audios do you remember? 

# Data Sources and Lineage

### Sources / Seeds
- *`stg_spotify_songs.sql`* kaggle spotify dataset of 20k+ popular songs between 2000 and 2020
- *`stg_tiktok_songs_on_spotify.sql`* 4 combined spotify datasets of popular tiktok songs between 2019 and 2022
- *`stg_tiktok_top_audio.sql`* top 100 tiktok audios by month over a 30-month period scraped from tokboard.com (2019 to mid-2021)
- *`other_artists.csv`* manually populated dataset that identifies official artists not included in the spotify datasets

*Note: all datasets I used were outside of the ones provided.*

### Intermediate Models
- *`int_tiktok_top_audio_cleaned.sql`* cleaned version of the scraped top 100 tiktok audio data
- *`int_combined_song_list.sql`* combined spotify dataset of the 20k+ popular songs and tiktok songs
- *`int_audio_performance.sql`* core metrics table handling all calculations

### Mart Models
- *`mrt_tiktok_performance_by_audio.sql`* core metrics associated with each tiktok audio
- *`mrt_tiktok_performance_by_author.sql`* core metrics associated with each tiktok author / song artist
- *`mrt_tiktok_top_audio_by_month 1:1`* of cleaned tiktok top 100 audio dataset
- *`mrt_spotify_song_detail.sql`* 1:1 of combined spotify dataset

### Macros
- *`performance_scores.sql`* macro to handle performance score (success metrics) composition / calculation

### Other
- *`add_genre.py`* (deprecated) python script to assign genre based on attributes to song tracks missing genre values

### Data Lineage

# Methodology + Metrics Definitions

### Tools
- **[Paradime](https://www.paradime.io/)** for SQL, dbtâ„¢
- **[MotherDuck](https://www.motherduck.com/)** for data storage and computing
- **[Hex](https://hex.tech/)** for analyses and data visualization

### Data Preparation
This analysis is built off of two datasets: spotify song data from two kaggle sources and tiktok top audio data that I scraped with AI.
1. For spotify song data, ensured that the data from the two sources did not duplicate *`select distinct`* and removed variants of the 
same song that had slightly different attributes using window functions: *`row_number()`* (ex: acousticness for variant A: .91, for variant B: .90)
2. Because the tiktok top audio dataset was scraped, many fields were weirdly formatted (ex: numeric fields stored as '1.6M views'). I used 
string parsing and datetime functions to extract the values I needed, in particular the user engagement data (# of viral videos, # of views) 
that are key for this analysis

### Key Metrics
Since the focus of the analysis revolves around tiktok audio performance, I created a composite performance metric to score and compare
each audio to identify which ones stand out. The composition of this metric is as follows:
- **Total Views**: these are views amassed across all viral videos associated with an audio across the 30-month period - in other words, viral views
- **Top 100 Appearances**: number of times an audio appeared on any monthly top 100 leaderboard per tokboard.com
- **Top 10 Appearances**: number of times an audio broke into any top 10 leaderboard by views
- **Average Ranking**: average leaderboard rank when an audio has appeared on the leaderboard
- **Max Ranking**: the highest ranking an audio has achieved

Because these metrics operate on different scales, they were all normalized to 0-1 before being funneled into the following formula to 
calculate the composite score. Score weighting was determined based on a subjective interpretation of performance.

- *`performance_score`* = 0.3x *`total`* + 0.2x *`top100_count`* + 0.2x *`top10_count`* + 0.15x *`avg_top100_rank`* + 0.15x `max_rank`*

As the definition of performance is highly variable depending on criteria, I shifted the weights around to create two performance score variants - one 
skewing toward consistency, and the other skewing toward peaks - since I was curious how that would impact results.

- *`consistency_score`* = 0.1x *`total`* + 0.5x *`top100_count`* + 0.1x *`top10_count`* + 0.2x *`avg_top100_rank`* + 0.1x *`max_rank`*
- *`peak_score`* = 0.1x *`total`* + 0.1x *`top100_count`* + 0.35x *`top10_count`* + 0.1x *`avg_top100_rank`* + 0.35x `max_rank`*

And just for fun, I reperformed this analysis on monthly rankings based on number of viral videos instead of number of views. This is where the 
performance calculation macro came in handy.

# Key Insights & Visualizations

### Data Profile
To start, let's take a quick look at the attributes of the dataset.


Right off the jump, three things stand out:
- Transient nature of TikTok audio: the average top 100 leaderboard appearance is a mere 1.6, with official songs doing slightly better at 1.92. 
This suggests that audio virality is short-lived (1-2 months), fads and trends shift rapidly, but also *every* audio has a shot and spot in the limelight.
- Top performers heavily skew dataset: with viral video and viral view averages that nearly doubling the median, it appears that after a certain range of
spots on the leaderboard, there is significant dropoff.


Looking at the viral view and viral video count averages,
