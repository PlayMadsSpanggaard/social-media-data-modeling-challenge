## Insights

This analysis explores the impact of social media usage patterns on various aspects of mental health, using a dataset that captures survey responses on social media habits and their psychological effects. The survey includes responses from a total of 481 respondents.

### Key Variables

- **Purposeless Use**: Respondents indicate how often they use social media without a specific purpose, highlighting aimless scrolling behaviors.
- **Distraction Frequency**: Measures how often respondents get distracted by social media when engaged in other activities.
- **Restlessness**: Assesses the level of restlessness respondents feel when they haven't used social media for a while, reflecting potential dependency.
- **Distraction Scale**: A self-rated scale (1-5) that gauges how easily respondents are distracted in general.
- **Worry Scale**: A self-rated scale (1-5) measuring how much respondents are bothered by worries, providing insight into their anxiety levels.
- **Concentration Difficulty**: Captures whether respondents struggle to concentrate on tasks, possibly linked to social media-induced distractions.
- **Comparison Scale**: Assesses how frequently respondents compare themselves to others on social media, highlighting the social comparison effect.
- **Comparison Feelings**: Explores respondents' general feelings about the comparisons they make on social media, revealing potential negative emotional impacts.
- **Validation Seek**: Measures how often respondents seek validation through social media, reflecting their need for external approval.
- **Depression Frequency**: Gauges how often respondents feel depressed or down, indicating potential links between social media use and mood disorders.
- **Interest Fluctuation**: A self-rated scale (1-5) that measures how frequently respondents' interest in daily activities fluctuates, possibly influenced by their social media habits.
- **Health Issues**: A self-rated scale (1-5) that assesses how often respondents face health issues, potentially correlating with their social media behaviors.

These variables help frame the relationship between social media usage patterns and their effects on mental well-being, allowing for deeper analysis of potential correlations and causations.
