# Objective
Uncovering insights around tiktok audio popularity across a variety of criteria, specifically during TikTok's early days thru the first year of COVID (roughly). 
1. Hook 1: Who is the King / Queen of TikTok audio?
2. Hook 2: What song held the most number 1 monthly leaderboard spots? Most Top 10 spots?
3. Hook 3: Are/were top tiktok audios mostly official songs or original sounds? 

For avid current and ex-TikTok users, how many of these audios do you remember? 

# Data Sources and Lineage

### Sources / Seeds
- *`stg_spotify_songs.sql`* kaggle spotify dataset of 20k+ popular songs between 2000 and 2020
- *`stg_tiktok_songs_on_spotify.sql`* 4 combined spotify datasets of popular tiktok songs between 2019 and 2022
- *`stg_tiktok_top_audio.sql`* top 100 tiktok audios by month over a 30-month period scraped from tokboard.com
- *`other_artists.csv`* manually populated dataset that identifies official artists not included in the spotify datasets

### Intermediate Models
- *`int_tiktok_top_audio_cleaned.sql`* cleaned version of the scraped top 100 tiktok audio data
- *`int_combined_song_list.sql`* combined spotify dataset of the 20k+ popular songs and tiktok songs
- *`int_audio_performance.sql`* core metrics table handling all calculations

### Mart Models
- *`mrt_tiktok_performance_by_audio.sql`* core metrics associated with each tiktok audio
- *`mrt_tiktok_performance_by_author.sql`* core metrics associated with each tiktok author / song artist
- *`mrt_tiktok_top_audio_by_month 1:1`* of cleaned tiktok top 100 audio dataset
- *`mrt_spotify_song_detail.sql`* 1:1 of combined spotify dataset

### Macros
- *`performance_scores.sql`* macro to handle performance score (success metrics) composition / calculation

### Other
- *`add_genre.py`* (deprecated) script to assign genre based on attributes to song tracks missing genre values

### Data Lineage


# Methodology + Metrics Definitions

### Tools
- **[Paradime](https://www.paradime.io/)** for SQL, dbtâ„¢
- **[MotherDuck](https://www.motherduck.com/)** for data storage and computing
- **[Hex](https://hex.tech/)** for analyses and data visualization

### Data Preparation
This analysis is built off of two datasets: spotify song data from two kaggle sources and tiktok top audio data that I scraped with AI.
1. For spotify song data, ensured that the data from the two sources did not duplicate *`select distinct`* and removed variants of the 
same song that had slightly different attributes using window functions: *`row_number()`* (ex: acousticness for variant A: .91, for variant B: .90)
2. Because the tiktok top audio dataset was scraped, many fields were weirdly formatted. I used string parsing and datetime functions to
extract the values I needed, in particular the user engagement data (# of viral videos, # of views) that are key for this analysis.

Note: as I do not have access to all tiktok engagement data spanning across every video, I am using leaderboard data as a proxy.

### Key Metrics
Since the focus of the analysis revolves around tiktok audio performance, I created a composite performance metric to score and compare
each audio to identify which ones stand out.

The composition of this metric is as follows:
- Total Views: these are views amassed across all viral videos associated with an audio across 30-month period
- Top 100 Appearances: number of times an audio appeared on any monthly top 100 leaderboard per tokboard.com
- Top 10 Appearances: number of times an audio broke into any top 10 leaderboard by views
- Average Ranking: average leaderboard rank when an audio has appeared on the leaderboard
- Max Ranking: the highest ranking an audio has achieved

Because these metrics operate on different scales, they were all normalized to 0-1 before being funneled into the following formula to 
calculate the composite score. Score weighting was determined based on a subjective interpretation of performance.

*`performance_score`*: 0.3x *`total`* + 0.2x *`top100_count`* + 0.2x `top10_count`* + 0.15x `avg_top100_rank`* + 0.2x `max_rank`*

As the definition of performance is subjective, I shifted the weights around to create two performance score variants - one 
skewing toward consistency, and the other skewing toward peaks - since I was curious how that would impact results.

*`consistency_score`*: 0.1x *`total`* + 0.5x *`top100_count`* + 0.1x `top10_count`* + 0.2x `avg_top100_rank`* + 0.1x `max_rank`*
*`peak_score`*: 0.1x *`total`* + 0.1x *`top100_count`* + 0.35x `top10_count`* + 0.1x `avg_top100_rank`* + 0.35x `max_rank`*

And just for fun, I reperformed this analysis on monthly rankings based on number of viral videos instead of number of views. This is where the 
performance calculation macro came in handy.
