## **üéØ Introduction and Objective**
Goal of this analysis is to uncover insights around TikTok audio virality and performance, specifically during TikTok's early days thru the first year of COVID (2019 thru mid-2021). Across the 30-months this analysis was performed on, we'll be able to find out things like:

1. Typically, how long does a TikTok sound‚Äôs virality last?
2. In that time frame, who was the King / Queen of TikTok audio by raw stats?
3. What audio was ‚Äúbest performing‚Äù overall? What about most consistent? Highest peaking?

‚Ä¶ and more!

*Note: all song urls are linked in the appendix section. For avid current and ex-TikTok users, how many of these audios do you remember üôÇ?*

## **‚öíÔ∏è Methodology and Definitions**

### **Tools**
- **[Paradime](https://www.paradime.io/)** for SQL, dbt‚Ñ¢
- **[MotherDuck](https://www.motherduck.com/)** for data storage and computing
- **[Hex](https://hex.tech/)** for analyses and data visualization

### **Data Preparation**
This analysis is built off of two datasets: spotify song data from two kaggle sources and tiktok top audio data that I scraped with AI.
1. For spotify song data, ensured that the data from the two sources did not duplicate *`select distinct`* and removed variants of the 
same song that had slightly different attributes using window functions: *`row_number()`* (ex: acousticness for variant A: .91, for variant B: .90)
2. Because the tiktok top audio dataset was scraped, many fields were weirdly formatted (ex: numeric fields stored as '1.6M views'). I used 
string parsing and datetime functions to extract the values I needed, in particular the user engagement data (# of viral videos, # of views) 
that are key for this analysis

### **Key Metrics**
Since the focus of the analysis revolves around tiktok audio performance, I created a composite performance metric to score and compare
each audio to identify which ones stand out. The composition of this metric is as follows:
- **Total Views**: these are views amassed across all viral videos associated with an audio across the 30-month period - in other words, viral views
- **Top 100 Appearances**: number of times an audio appeared on any monthly top 100 leaderboard per tokboard.com
- **Top 10 Appearances**: number of times an audio broke into any top 10 leaderboard by views
- **Average Ranking**: average leaderboard rank when an audio has appeared on the leaderboard
- **Max Ranking**: the highest ranking an audio has achieved

Because these metrics operate on different scales, they were all normalized to 0-1 before being funneled into the following formula to 
calculate the composite score. Score weighting was determined based on a subjective interpretation of performance.

- *`performance_score`* = 0.3x *`total`* + 0.2x *`top100_count`* + 0.2x *`top10_count`* + 0.15x *`avg_top100_rank`* + 0.15x `max_rank`*

As the definition of performance is highly variable depending on criteria, I shifted the weights around to create two performance score variants - one 
skewing toward consistency, and the other skewing toward peaks - since I was curious how that would impact results.

- *`consistency_score`* = 0.1x *`total`* + 0.5x *`top100_count`* + 0.1x *`top10_count`* + 0.2x *`avg_top100_rank`* + 0.1x *`max_rank`*
- *`peak_score`* = 0.1x *`total`* + 0.1x *`top100_count`* + 0.35x *`top10_count`* + 0.1x *`avg_top100_rank`* + 0.35x `max_rank`*

And just for fun, I reperformed this analysis on monthly rankings based on number of viral videos instead of number of views. This is where the 
performance calculation macro came in handy.

## **üìä Key Insights and Visualizations**


### <sub> Section 00 </sub>
### **Data Profile - What Stands Out?**


To start, let's take a quick look at the attributes of the dataset. (See references section for all song YouTube links)


Right off the jump, a couple things stand out:
1. Transient nature of TikTok audio: the average top 100 leaderboard appearance is a mere 1.6, with official songs doing slightly better at 1.92. 
This suggests that audio virality is short-lived (1-2 months), fads and trends shift rapidly, but also that *every* audio has a shot and spot in the limelight.
2. Top performers heavily skew dataset: with viral video and viral view averages nearly doubling the median, it appears that after a certain range of
spots on the leaderboard, there is significant dropoff.


This chart sheds more light onto our second observation - top 10 audios appear to peak significantly higher than the rest of the top 100. This could be
due to TikTok's algorithm or a reflection the user base's capacity to push and promote viral trends or something else entirely. This, however, is outside the
scope of this analysis.

### <sub> Section 01 </sub>
### **Stat Stuffers of 2019 thru Mid-2021: Audios/Artists That Took Over TikTok**

Before we dive into the meat of this analysis, let's take a look at the top performing audios and artists by gross stats alone.

Unsurprisingly, 


Very clearly, official songs dominate the top 10 leaderboards
-- total views
-- total viral videos

### <sub> Section 02 </sub>
### **The "Best Performing" TikTok Audios - Standardized and Scored**
Moving onto the main course of this analysis, we'll score and rank each audio across this period using a composite performance score weighted comprehensively
using a combination of gross stats and virality/popularity relative to the competition. See methodology here: 


reaffirms the balance of the original performance score

Final jursidiction
- measure reach in two ways - viral content created and viral content consumed

&nbsp;
### <sub> Section 03 </sub>
### **Predictors of Success: Which Song Attributes Do Well?**
-- more likely to be consistent or peak
-- which variables highly impact performance

-- unimpressive .103% R-squared value means that only 8% of variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables
-- suggests
    - many paths to popularity - reflection of hhumanity
    - limited dataset
    - looking at the wrong attributes

Importance_score vs coefficient_score

&nbsp;
### <sub> Bonus Section </sub>
### **Bonus**
-- Movement of Monkey Spinning Monkeys
-- Most dominant #1
-- Final top 10 more representative after late-2019 - skewed by total view count (as TikTok grew) or due to the wild-west nature of early TikTok

-- Lottery (Renegade)
-- Roxanne
-- What you know about love
-- Say So
-- Tap In

## **üìÉ Summary and Conclusions**

TikTok audio is highly transient

## **ü™û Reflection**
All things considered the dataset I used was pretty limited, given that I joined the challenge a little over a week before the due date
- better dataset (more comprehensive, with more attributes, more recent) - more accurate time series analysis
    - skew toward songs in 2020, knowing what I know now, perform analysis on separate years or even half years or quarter of years (transience of tiktok audio)
- Look at things like geography (where are these values coming from)
- Do a deeper analysis on what drives virality - number of trends/fads associated with each audio (hashtag analysis), accessibility of an audio
- D)
- Are there any Christmas songs that can compete with Mariah Carey
