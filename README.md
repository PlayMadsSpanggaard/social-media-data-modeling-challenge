## **üéØ Introduction and Objective**
Goal of this analysis is to uncover insights around TikTok audio virality and performance, specifically during TikTok's early days thru the first year of COVID (2019 thru mid-2021). Across the 30-months this analysis was performed on, we'll be able to find out things like:

1. Typically, how long does a TikTok sound‚Äôs virality last?
2. In that time frame, who was the King / Queen of TikTok audio by raw stats?
3. What audio was ‚Äúbest performing‚Äù overall? What about most consistent? Highest peaking?

‚Ä¶ and more!

## **‚öíÔ∏è Methodology and Definitions**

### **Tools**
- **[Paradime](https://www.paradime.io/)** for SQL, dbt‚Ñ¢
- **[MotherDuck](https://www.motherduck.com/)** for data storage and computing
- **[Hex](https://hex.tech/)** for analyses and data visualization

### **Data Preparation**
This analysis is built off of two main datasets: Spotify song data from two kaggle sources and TikTok top audio data that I scraped with AI.

- For Spotify song data, ensured that the data from the two sources did not duplicate and removed variants of the same song that 
had slightly different attributes using window functions (*`row_number()`* for ex: acousticness for variant A: .91, for variant B: .90)

- Many fields in the TikTok top audio dataset were not properly formatted (ex: numeric fields stored as '1.6M views'). I used string parsing, 
datetime functions, data type conversions to extract the values I needed, in particular the user engagement data (# of viral videos, # of views) 
that were key for this analysis.


### **Key Metrics**
The two engagement metrics at the center of this analysis are the following: viral views and viral video count.

1. **Viral views** measure the total number of views accumulated across all videos that have gone viral. This highlights the ***depth of engagement***, showing the extent of consumption.
2. **Viral video count** is the count of videos that have achieved viral status by rapidly amassing hundreds of thousands of views. This highlights the ***spread of virality*** and how many pieces of content are able to achieve significant traction.

Since the focus of the analysis revolves around TikTok audio performance, I created a composite performance metric to score and compare each audio to identify which ones stand above the rest. The composition of this metric is as follows:

- **Totals**: these are virals views or viral videos associated with an audio across the 30-month period
- **Top 100 Appearances**: number of times an audio appeared on any monthly top 100 leaderboard per tokboard.com
- **Top 10 Appearances**: number of times an audio broke into any monthly top 10
- **Average Ranking**: average leaderboard rank when an audio has appeared on the leaderboard
- **Max Ranking**: the highest ranking an audio has achieved

Because these metrics operate on different scales, they were all normalized to 0-1 before being funneled into the following formula to calculate the composite score. Score weighting was 
determined based on a subjective interpretation of performance.

- *`performance_score`* = 0.3x `total` + 0.2x `top100_count` + 0.2x `top10_count` + 0.15x `avg_top100_rank` + 0.15x `max_rank`

As the definition of performance is highly variable depending on criteria, I shifted the weights around to create two performance score variants - one skewing toward consistency, and the other 
skewing toward peaks - since I was curious how that would impact results.

- *`consistency_score`* = 0.1x `total` + 0.5x `top100_count` + 0.1x `top10_count` + 0.2x `avg_top100_rank` + 0.1x `max_rank`
- *`peak_score`* = 0.1x `total` + 0.1x `top100_count` + 0.35x top10_count + 0.1x `avg_top100_rank` + 0.35x `max_rank`

**I performed this calculation twice, once on totals and monthly rankings based on the number of viral views and a second time based on the number of viral videos.** Because viral views and 
viral video count measure reach in different ways, I was interested in understanding how this would impact the results. This is where the performance calculation macro came in handy.

The idea behind this scoring method is that measuring performance requires context beyond gross stats and using leaderboard rankings help account for other factors like competitive dynamics.

## **üìä Key Insights and Visualizations**


### <sub> Section 00 </sub>
### **Data Profile - What Stands Out?**
To start, let's take a quick look at the attributes of the dataset.

*Note: these stats reflect the ~3,000 records of the top 100 leaderboard charts over 30 months.*

![data_profile](https://github.com/paradime-io/social-media-data-modeling-challenge/blob/jayeson-gao/screenshots/data_profile.png?raw=true)

Right off the jump, a couple things stand out:

1. **The transient nature of TikTok audio** - the average number of top 100 monthly leaderboard appearances is a mere 1.6, with official songs 
doing slightly better at 1.92. This suggests that audio virality is short-lived (1-2 months), fads and trends shift rapidly, but also that there
 are opportunities for different audios to enjoy the limelight.
2. **There are the top performers, then there are the rest** - with viral video and viral view averages nearly doubling the median, it appears 
that the dataset is heavily skewed by top performers. After a certain ranking on the leaderboard, there is likely a significant dropoff.

![data_profile_rank_buckets](https://github.com/paradime-io/social-media-data-modeling-challenge/blob/jayeson-gao/screenshots/data_profile_rank_buckets.png?raw=true)

This chart sheds more light onto our second observation - **audios that occupy the monthly top 10 spots accumulate a significantly higher volume of viral stats than the rest 
of the top 100**. This could be due to TikTok's algorithm or a reflection of the user base's capacity to process, participate, and promote viral trends or something else entirely. 
This, however, is outside the scope of this analysis.

*Note: if you‚Äôre wondering why this chart isn‚Äôt a perfect staircase, outlier months where ranks in a given rank bucket vastly outperform their rank counterparts in other months combined with 
the fact that rank values were ranked with `rank()` instead of `row_number()` causing certain ranks to be skipped at lower levels in given months, create a funky situation 
where some of the lower rank buckets ‚Äúoutperform‚Äù their higher rank counterparts.*

&nbsp;

### <sub> Section 01 </sub>
### **Stat Stuffers of 2019 thru Mid-2021: Audios/Artists That Took Over TikTok**
Before we dive into the meat of this analysis, let's take a look at the top performing audios and artists by gross stats alone.

![top_10_gross_audio](https://github.com/paradime-io/social-media-data-modeling-challenge/blob/jayeson-gao/screenshots/top_10_gross_audio.png?raw=true)

Here we look at the top 10 by gross stats ranked by total number of viral views and number of viral videos. Interestingly enough, the top 2 on both leaderboards are occupied by Laxed (Siren Beat) 
by Jawsh 685 - the sound behind Savage Love with Jason Derulo - and Banana (feat. Shaggy) by Conkarah, with Monkeys Spinning Monkeys by Kevin MacLeod, Savage by Megan Thee Stallion, Oh No by Kreepa, 
and Surrender by Natalie Taylor rounding out the top 6 on both charts.

We also make the following observations:

1. **Renegade and the influence of Charli D‚ÄôAmelio** - if you were wondering what the ‚ÄòRenegade‚Äô song was, it‚Äôs Lottery by K CAMP, which unsurprisingly makes a cameo at 9th on the viral views leaderboard.
2. **Steph Curry from way downtown** - üéµI‚Äôm Steph Curry when I hit the 3 I hit the whoa üéµ Well, not exactly Steph Curry, but KRYPTO9095‚Äôs song Woah cracks in at the 10th spot by total viral views. 
3. **Official songs dominate in gross stats at the top** - even the original of the Bagaikan Langit (cover) seems to be an official Indonesian song.

![top_10_gross_author](https://github.com/paradime-io/social-media-data-modeling-challenge/blob/jayeson-gao/screenshots/top_10_gross_author.png?raw=true)

![top_10_gross_author_table](https://github.com/paradime-io/social-media-data-modeling-challenge/blob/jayeson-gao/screenshots/top_10_gross_author_table.png?raw=true)

Shifting over to gross stats by audio author/artists, we observe the following:

1. **Queens of TikTok** - Can‚Äôt talk TikTok without bringing up Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion. With iconic songs like Say So, Kiss Me More, Savage, and Body, it‚Äôs not a surprise that the gross stats back it up.
2. **One hit wonders: all it takes is one** - Light purple represents artists with only 1 audio that has made any top 100 list over this time period. Here are the songs associated with these artists: Jawsh 685 (Laxed), Kreepa (Oh No), K CAMP (Lottery), and KRYPTO9095 (Woah), StaySolidRocky (Party Girl).

&nbsp;

### <sub> Section 02 </sub>
### **The "Best Performing" TikTok Audios - Standardized and Scored**
Moving onto the main course of this analysis, we'll score and rank each audio across this period using a composite performance score
using a combination of gross stats and ranking stats (see methodology). 

The initial approach I took to calculating performance score is off of viral views. 

![top_10_best_performing](https://github.com/paradime-io/social-media-data-modeling-challenge/blob/jayeson-gao/screenshots/top_10_best_performing.png?raw=true)

- **COVID-19 blues?** - After computing all the normalized scores based on viral view count and viral view rankings, it appears that Surrender by Natalie Taylor 
has claimed the title of ‚Äúbest performing‚Äù, but let‚Äôs take a closer look at the component scores.

![top_10_best_performing_normalized](https://github.com/paradime-io/social-media-data-modeling-challenge/blob/jayeson-gao/screenshots/top_10_best_performing_normalized.png?raw=true)

To recap, total views (norm_total_views) represents viral reach. Number of top 100 appearances (norm_top100_app) and average top 100 rank (norm_avg_top100_rank) measure the 
consistency of performance while number of top 10 appearances (norm_top10_app) and max rank (norm_max_rank) evaluate peak success.

With that said, what stands out?

1. **Funny business or monkey business?** - Monkeys Spinning Monkeys breaks into the top 10 ‚Äúbest performing‚Äù and claims the number 7 spot with a norm_top10_app (green bar) 
value of 0, meaning that it has no top 10 appearances on any monthly viral views leaderboard. However, it boasts a strong norm_top100_app score of 0.86, second to only the 
top spot which is a testament to its consistency.
2. **The ‚Äúbest performers‚Äù all have high peaks** - 9 of 10 audios have norm_max_rank scores between 0.9 - 1 (Monkeys Spinning Monkeys at 0.89 ü•≤) indicating they have all 
peaked on a monthly leaderboard at some point. 6 of the 10 audios have max the norm_top10_app scores indicating multiple months where they have broken into the top 10. 
3. **Surrender by Natalie Taylor: the hallmark of consistency** - Interestingly enough, the top spot doesn‚Äôt boast the greatest peak metrics, but is instead carried by its 
consistency and totals. With a norm_top100_app score of 1, the song has made the most number of top 100 monthly viral views leaderboards. 

A more detailed looks at what those normalized scores correspond to:

![top_10_best_performing_table](https://github.com/paradime-io/social-media-data-modeling-challenge/blob/jayeson-gao/screenshots/top_10_best_performing_table_appendix.png?raw=true)

Now what happens when we reallocate the weights to reward either consistent performance or peak performance?

![best_performing_consistency](https://github.com/paradime-io/social-media-data-modeling-challenge/blob/jayeson-gao/screenshots/best_performing_consistency.png?raw=true)

When we skew for consistency, what we find is that‚Ä¶

1. **Consistency is rare** - Surrender by Natalie Taylor is undisputedly the most consistent ‚Äúbest performer‚Äù, with a commanding edge over the rest of the top 10. Are we surprised by 
this after seeing the previous charts and tables?
2. **This Spongebob audio remix is the lone representative of non-official song audio** - Or is it? While the sound that trends on TikTok is a remix, it is technically based off of an 
officially produced sound. Regardless, it cracks the top 5 here as a - in Gen Z terms - certified hood classic.

![best_performing_peak](https://github.com/paradime-io/social-media-data-modeling-challenge/blob/jayeson-gao/screenshots/best_performing_peak.png?raw=true)

When we skew for peak, we find that‚Ä¶

1. **Audios take turns in the spotlight** - There is little separating the ‚Äúbest performers‚Äù. Two audios are tied for first, and all top 10 audios are separated by a score difference of 0.04. 
In fact, there is not a major drop-off in performance score until rank 16. With so many audios laying claim to ‚Äúbest performer‚Äù when we skew for peak, it reinforces one of our initial 
observations: virality is short-lived and many audios can enjoy the limelight though at different times.

2. **Official songs reign supreme** - While we see 4 non-official audios/songs represented in this group, Spongebob and Hot Headzz Ya Ya are based on officially produced sounds and created by 
smaller artists (not picked up in the data cleaning process) respectively. Even Patatak, which is tied for 10th, is derived from a Dominican Republic song.

.

.

.

This leads us to the conclusion of this section: 

**Which song truly deserves the title of ‚Äúbest performing‚Äù audio?**

Since viral views only measure reach in one dimension, I calculated a second performance score off of metrics and rankings based on viral video count.

Using the methodology here, swapped out total views for total videos and rankings based on views for rankings based on videos. Then, created a **final performance score that 
takes the average of the view-based performance score and video-based performance score**.


*`final_performance_score`* = 0.5x *`performance_score_by_views`* + 0.5x *`performance_score_by_videos`*

&nbsp;

So then... (drum roll please)

Our final winner is‚Ä¶

## **üìÉ Summary and Conclusions**

TikTok audio is highly transient

***

## **ü™û Reflection**
All things considered the dataset I used was pretty limited, given that I joined the challenge a little over a week before the due date
- better dataset (more comprehensive, with more attributes, more recent) - more accurate time series analysis
    - skew toward songs in 2020, knowing what I know now, perform analysis on separate years or even half years or quarter of years (transience of tiktok audio)
- Look at things like geography (where are these values coming from)
- Do a deeper analysis on what drives virality - number of trends/fads associated with each audio (hashtag analysis), accessibility of an audio
- D)
- Are there any Christmas songs that can compete with Mariah Carey
