  - name: int_instagram_hashtags
    description: |
      This model extracts hashtags from Instagram post descriptions and retains the `sid` (post ID).
      The hashtags are filtered to ensure they start with `#`, and the results include the post ID for 
      potential future reference to the original posts. The grain of the model is a single hashtag per post.
    columns:
      - name: sid
        description: |
          The unique identifier for each Instagram post. This field allows linking the extracted hashtags 
          back to the original post for further analysis.

      - name: hashtag
        description: |
